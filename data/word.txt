Nothing succeeds lacks confidence. When you are truly and justifiably confident, it radiates from you like sunlight, and attracts success to you like a magnet. It's important to believe in yourself. Believe that you can do it under any circumstances, because if you believe you can, then you really will.The belief keeps you searching for answers, which means that pretty soon you will get them. Confidence is more than an attitude. It comes from knowing exactly where you are going and exactly how you are going to get there. It comes from acting with integrity and confidence. It comes from a strong sense of purpose. It comes from a strong commitment to take responsibility, rather than just letting life happen. One way to develop self-confidence is to do the thing you fear and to get a record of successful experiences behind you. Confidence is compassionate and understanding. It is not arrogant. Arrogance is born out of fear and insecurity, while confidence comes from strength and integrity. Confidence is not just believing you can do it. Confidence is knowing you can do it.Know that you are capable of accomplishing anything you want,and live your life with confidence. Anything can be achieved through focused, determined effort and self-confidence. If your life is not what you want it to be,you have the power to change it,and you must make the changes on a moment by moment basis. Live your priorities. Live with your goals and your plan of action. Live each moment with your priorities in mind. Act with your own purpose, and you will have the life you want.
